Hi, this is the preliminary post to my "thoughts" series.

Oftentimes I'll want to write about something that's incomplete, or ponder on a topic
that's underexplored or seemingly banal yet not solved. Finding the motivation to spend my time on a long-form
blog post exploring all the nuances of a concept is difficult, and so I'll be noting down simple concepts and ideas in this "thoughts" series.

Also, I like going on tangential, quick programming side projects -- things that just happen to grab my attention for the moment. Sometimes I'll want
to announce a new mini-project without going into all the details, sometimes I'll just want to shout a question into the void in order to get it off my chest.

Hopefully this thoughts series helps me with that and motivates me. If I get all the quick ideas off my chest, maybe I'll have more motivation to write something longer :)
